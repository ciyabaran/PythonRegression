We used Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv [1] and vgsales-12-4-2019.csv [2].

By using Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv, we found the answers for our questions such as:
- "What will be score of the newly released game?"
- "What are the top selling games?"
- "Which platforms have more games?"
- "Global sales for genres by years"
- "What are North American sales relative to sales in other regions?"
- "Which continent plays which game more?"

By using vgsales-12-4-2019.csv,
- "Which platform should be focused on for the new games from the publisherâ€™s perspective?"

And we visualized them with graphics and tables by using some libraries.
We used machine learning algorithms such as linear regression and logistic regression.
